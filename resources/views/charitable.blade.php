                    <h2 class="mb-4">Dr. OP Singh's Educational Philanthropy</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4"> Dr. OP Singh, a philanthropist and educationist, embarked on his charitable journey thirteen years ago. He began by providing free coaching to 3000 students from government schools in Himachal Pradesh, who came from underprivileged families. This coaching was specifically focused on preparing them for the NEET examination, which is required for admission to medical schools in India.
</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In addition to his efforts in Himachal Pradesh, Dr. OP Singh also initiated a two-year integrated course, free of cost, for economically disadvantaged students in the Kalka constituency of Haryana. This course aimed to provide comprehensive education and guidance to these students, enabling them to pursue higher studies or find suitable job opportunities. Another significant initiative undertaken by Dr. OP Singh and his team was the adoption of a girl senior secondary school in Sector 15. They offered free coaching and job-oriented courses to the students of this school, empowering them with the necessary skills and knowledge for a brighter future.
<br>
 
Furthermore, Dr. OP Singh and his dedicated team launched a crash course program for one hundred talented girl students from Punjab. This program was conducted at the Meritorious Students' School in Mohali, focusing on preparing the students for their respective examinations and enhancing their academic performance. Dr. OP Singh and his team have a unique and distinct vision for education in Northern India. Their efforts have garnered immense appreciation from parents and students alike, as they strive to provide equal opportunities and empower underprivileged students. Their mission is commendable and greatly impacts the lives of those they assist.
